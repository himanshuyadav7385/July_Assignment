What is this project ?
This project explores the data from UCI Machine Learning repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The survey describes different driving scenarios including the destination, current time, weather, passenger, etc., and then ask the person whether he will accept the coupon if he is the driver. 

I have utilized my knowledge of plotting, statistical summaries, and visualization using Python to highlights the differences between customers who did and did not accept the coupons.

Check the Jupyter notebook file for complete report containing code and visualizations . Brief summary below.

Prompts given in assignment 
- Identify missing data
- Data cleanup
- Overall acceptance percentage
- exploring different types of coupons
- exploring different temperatures when coupon was offered.
- Investigate bar coupons
- acceptance of bar coupons by driver category.

Self investigation
- Investigate coupons for expensive restautants
- build graphs for different factors and draw conclusions
- Identify areas for further investigation 
- Further investigate - Widowed and Divorced have much higher rejection rate and unmarried partner having the highest acceptance rate. Are there any other factors affecting this ?
